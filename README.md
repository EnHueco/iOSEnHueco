# iOSEnHueco

### What is it?
[EnHueco] is an online system that allows university members (students and teachers) to share their weekly schedule information with other members of the community, so that they're able to plan work meetings, leisure time and any other activity together. 

This repository contains the iOS mobile version of the platform. It allows iOS users to connect to the system and use it either with mobile data or offline. 

**Check out the Android version of EnHueco [here](https://github.com/EnHueco/AndroidEnHueco).**
